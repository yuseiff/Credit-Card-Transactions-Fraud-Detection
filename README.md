# Credit-Card-Transactions-Fraud-Detection

This project focuses on credit card transaction fraud detection using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of credit card transaction records labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new credit card transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on various features associated with the transactions. The project begins by importing necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The dataset is loaded from two CSV files named 'fraudTrain.csv' and 'fraudTest.csv' using pandas' read_csv() function and stored in separate DataFrames for training and testing data. After loading the datasets, some initial exploration is performed. The shape and information of the datasets are checked to understand their sizes and the available columns. The missing values in both datasets are identified and counted. Descriptive statistics are computed to gain insights into the numerical features of the datasets. Data visualization techniques are employed to further understand the data. Count plots and pie charts are used to visualize the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, as well as the distribution of genders in the dataset. Histograms are used to visualize the distributions of the 'zip' and 'lat' features. Data preprocessing steps are then performed. A subset of features is selected for the analysis, and the corresponding columns are extracted from the datasets. The feature variables are assigned to 'x_train' and 'x_test', while the target variables (fraud labels) are assigned to 'y_train' and 'y_test'. Next, a logistic regression model is trained using the selected features and the target variable. The LogisticRegression() class from scikit-learn is used to instantiate a logistic regression model, and the fit() method is called to train the model on the training data. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy_score() and mean_squared_error() functions from scikit-learn's metrics module. The accuracy score measures the proportion of correctly classified transactions, while the mean squared error provides an indication of the model's overall error. Finally, the accuracy scores and mean squared errors for both the training and testing data are printed to assess the model's performance on both datasets. Overall, this project showcases the process of building and evaluating a logistic regression model for credit card transaction fraud detection. It involves data loading, exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
